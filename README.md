# FSscoreboard

#### Hello again! I'm back with another release and must admit, I never thought I'd release a scoreboard.

---

This is a simple scoreboard that took design inspiration from panzarb's scoreboard which can be found [here](https://github.com/panzarb/scoreboard).

This scoreboard has been completely redesigned and fitted with the most updated and proficient code as of today. The scoreboard takes a simplistic design, yet still feels like just the right amount of information. The scoreboard is designed to take in as many players as a server can fit. 

The scoreboard is a toggled NUI to the key you set in the configuration file. When the scoreboard is toggled, every key input will be disabled except for the key you set to open and close the menu. The scoreboard will also show a mouse whilst toggled as when it reaches a certain amount of players, it will initiate a scroll wheel allowing you to scroll and see everyone connected to the server.

Besides that, it's pretty straightforward.
